# GitHub Copilot Chat Modes: Presentation Notes

## Introduction (5 minutes)

### Welcome and Session Overview
- Welcome participants to Session 2 of the AI Club
- Today's focus: GitHub Copilot's chat capabilities, specifically the three main modes
- Emphasize practical application through the expense tracker exercise

### What are GitHub Copilot Chat Modes?
- **GitHub Copilot Chat**: An AI-powered coding assistant that goes beyond autocomplete
- Integrated directly in VS Code and GitHub.com
- Helps with coding tasks, explanations, troubleshooting, and more

### The Three Main Chat Modes

1. **Ask Mode (Default)**
   - For general questions, explanations, and advice
   - DEMO: Show how to ask about a React concept or pattern
   - Example prompt: "How does React's useEffect hook work?"

2. **Edit Mode**
   - For modifying existing code or generating new code with specific instructions
   - DEMO: Select a component and ask Copilot to modify it
   - Example prompt: `/edit add proper error handling to this function`

3. **Agent Mode**
   - For complex tasks that require project understanding or multiple files
   - DEMO: Ask Copilot to scan the project and suggest improvements
   - Example prompt: `/agent create a new component for filtering expenses`

## Live Demonstration (5 minutes)

### Setting Up
- Show how to access GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code
- Keyboard shortcuts: `Ctrl+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+I` (Mac)
- Chat panel location and interface

### Practical Examples with the Expense Tracker
1. **Ask Mode Example**
   - Ask: "What's the best way to handle form submission in this expense tracker?"
   - Show Copilot's explanation and advice

2. **Edit Mode Example**
   - Select the `ExpenseForm.jsx` component
   - Type: `/edit add validation to ensure amount is a positive number`
   - Show how Copilot modifies the code

3. **Agent Mode Example**
   - Type: `/agent add localStorage functionality to persist expenses between page reloads`
   - Show how Copilot analyzes the project and implements the feature

## Exercise Introduction (2 minutes)
- Overview of the expense tracker application structure
- Explanation of the tasks to be completed
- Tips for effective prompting

## Hands-on Exercise (20 minutes)
- Participants work on their own to complete tasks
- Walk around to assist and observe different approaches
- Provide guidance on effective prompting if needed

## Wrap-up and Discussion (5 minutes)

### Key Takeaways
- Ask Mode: Best for knowledge gaps and understanding concepts
- Edit Mode: Efficient for targeted code modifications
- Agent Mode: Powerful for complex, multi-file operations

### Best Practices

2. Provide context when needed
3. Verify and understand the code Copilot generates
4. Use the right mode for each task

### Q&A
- Open the floor for questions and discussion
- Encourage participants to share their experiences from the exercise

### Next Steps
